![XKCD](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git_commit.png)

Welcome to the XKCD Data Hub! ðŸ‘‹

Imagine fetching your favorite XKCD comics, streaming them to a service that
neatly organizes everything using some cool engineering tricks, and then serving
it all up to your eager fingertips. That's what this project is all about! ðŸŽ‰

## Features

- Fetch the latest XKCD comic information.
- Stream data to a projection service using CQRS and the outbox pattern.
- Serve data from an Event Store to the client.
- Easy setup and deployment using Docker Compose.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- JDK 21 or higher
- Kotlin 2.0 or higher
- Gradle build system

### Steps to Run the Project Locally

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/yonatankarp/xkcd-data-hub.git
   $ cd xkcd-data-hub
   $ git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```
2. **Build the Project:**

   ```sh
   ./gradlew build
   ```
3. **Run the Infrastructure using Docker Compose:**

   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This will start all the necessary infrastructure including databases,
   message brokers, and any other related components.

### Architecture

The project contains multiple submodules. Here's a brief overview of each:
* [Gateway](./gateway/README) - A facade for the client application to interact
with.
* [Fetcher](./fetcher/README) - Built using ktor, collects information about
XKCD comics, and streams it to the projection service.
* [Data Processor](./data-processor/README) - stores and serves XKCD comic data
to clients.
* [Client Application](./client-app/README) - provides a user interface to
interact with the XKCD data via API.
